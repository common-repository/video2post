A plugin to import projects made at [Video2Post.com](https://video2post.com) into a Wordpress installation as a post.

and insert media cuts of audio and video directly from the editor, take screenshots, create gif by selecting the
text that belongs to that part of the media! You can export to several formats, including the import of the project into a Wordpress
installation as a Post, including all the media and text formatting generated in the Video2Post editor.
